Alpine ibex dataset
This dataset consists of SNP data that was produced by Brambilla et al. (2024) using an
amplicon sequencing assay designed by Kessler et al. (2021). The SNP assay has been
developed for alpine ibex conservation and population monitoring and includes different sets
of SNPs for specific purposes such as hybrid detection.
In this dataset, you will find a subset of 528 SNPs, 465 of which are supposedly neutral and 63
that are diagnostic of hybridisation, meaning that they should be different in goats and ibexes
(e.g. all goats have A and all ibexes have T). There are a total of 159 samples: 127 alpine ibex, 12
domestic goat and 20 suspected hybrids. Due to the near extinction of the species in the 19th
century, the only remaining native population of alpine ibex is in the Gran Paradiso National
Park in Italy, nevertheless this dataset includes samples from Austrian, French, Italian and Swiss
populations resulting from a captive breeding and reintroduction program.
With the neutral SNPs, you could investigate population structure and try to recreate the
reintroduction history of the species after the near extinction event in the 19th century. You
could also explore genetic diversity and examine whether previous conservation efforts have
been effective.
With the diagnostic SNPs, you will be able to identify ibex/goat hybrids in the dataset and
estimate their proportion of ancestry of each species. You could also specifically look at those
sites and their position in the genome to see if they are biologically meaningful to either
species.
