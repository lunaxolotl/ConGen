# Genetic Diversity And Bottlenecks in Reintroduced Alpine Ibex Populations

This project investigates the genetic consequences of historical and reintroduction-related bottlenecks in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) populations. Using SNP genotype data from multiple populations, we assessed genetic structure, diversity, and demographic history through PCA, heterozygosity analyses, genetic distance matrices, and Tajimaâ€™s D. Our results reveal strong founder effects and reduced genetic variation in reintroduced populations, highlighting the long-term genetic impacts of conservation translocations and the need for ongoing genetic monitoring.
